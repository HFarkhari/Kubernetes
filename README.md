Welcome to my GitHub repository! 

I recently had the opportunity to present at the AI RoundTable, a global gathering of AI experts who come together to discuss the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. We shared valuable insights and slides covering various topics, including the state-of-the-art techniques in AI, machine learning, and deep learning. We also discussed recent papers, essential tools, industry experiences, and effective ways to handle AI challenges.

To enhance the learning experience, I provided an introduction to using Kubernetes by demonstrating how to install and run Minikube. Additionally, I showcased two Python programs that communicate with each other using the ZMQ API. To streamline the deployment process, I containerized both programs using Docker and successfully ran them on Minikube for efficient management and monitoring.

If you missed the live session or want to revisit the content, you can access the recorded video of my presentation titled "Intro to Kubernetes | AI RoundTable #17" at the following link:

I highly recommend checking out the other informative sessions as well on the AI RoundTable YouTube channel, which can be found at '@airoundtable'.

Furthermore, if you're interested in properly installing Docker for deep learning frameworks on Ubuntu Linux, enabling smooth communication with Nvidia CUDA, I have conducted a series of Docker-related sessions. In these sessions, I walk you through the correct installation process and provide guidance on working with AI Docker images. You can find the videos for these sessions below:
